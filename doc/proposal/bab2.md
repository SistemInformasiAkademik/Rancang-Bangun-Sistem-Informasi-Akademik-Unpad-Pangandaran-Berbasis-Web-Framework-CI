The design of the system is the determination of the process and data iperlukan by the new system, computer-based systems, perancangn apat inyatakan specification of the equipment usedn</p>
<b>2.2	Understanding information systems</b>
<p align="justify">
Information system is a system in an organization that meet the needs of the management of transactions, supporting the operation, activities and strategies of the managerial nature of an organization and provides a certain outside parties with the required reports.

Academic information system is a system that menberikan information services in the form of data in matters relating to the Academy. Where in this case the ministries i.e like: new data for storage, penetuan, determining the schedule class lessons, teaching schedules, making sharing of homeroom, the assessment process.</p>

2.4	 Understanding Codeigniter</b>
<p align="justify">
CodeIgniter is a framework that has been equipped with the amenities that make it easy for users to make apps website. For example, the existence of error reporting facilities. However, error reporting facilities. But this facility can also be used to find out the hacker kelemaham our website anyway, so with the weakness of our website, the system can be penetrated. CodeIigniter constructed based MVC (Models, View, Controller) which separates the display and application logic. Models Â¬ is the part that betanggungjawab against the database operations either create, read, and delete upadate be operational database functions that are called by the controller. View is part of the deal with the appearance, this is part of the duty to present data to the user shape the structure of HTML that contains variable data sent by the controller. The controller is the part that regulates the relationship between the model and the view. Consists of functions that are logical operations.

2.5 Understanding Bootstrap <br>

CCS Bootstrap is a front-end framework that uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript that can make web applications that are responsive and can be used on the scope of the mobile devices can make a Web page, table layout, buttons, forms, naviasi and other components in a website.

<b> 2.6 Understanding MySQL </b>
< p align = "justify" >
MySQL is a database server belongs to the software and is opensource. Open Source States that this software comes with source code (the code that is used to create MySQL) that can be run directly in the operating system. Multiplatform nature i.e. MySQL can run on different operating systems. Access databases can be done easily through the SQL (Structured Query Language). The data in the database can be accessed through the web or non application of web applications such as PHP.

<b> 2.7 Understanding UML </b>

In general the UML is the ' language ' for visualization, specification, construction, as well as documentation. Within the framework of the visualization, the developers use UML as a way to communicate the idea to programmers as well as prospective users of the system/software.
In the keangka specification, UML provides the right models, not double-meaning of (ambiguous), as well as complete. In particular, the UML specifies important steps in decision making analysis, design, and implementation in a very nuanced system software. In this case the UML is not a programming language but the models that are created directly related to a wide range of object-oriented programming languages, such as Java, Delphi, C++, Visual Basic, and others. Defining the UML diagrams as follows:
<b> 2.7.1 Use Case Diagrams </b>
Use case diagrams describe the functionality expected from a system. That are emphasized are the "what" that made the system, and not the "how". A use case represents an interaction between actors with the system.
2.7.2 <b> Class Diagram </b>
A class is a specification that if the diinstansiasi will produce an object and is the core of development and object-oriented design. The class describes the State (attributes/properties) of a system, while also offering services to manipulate the situation (the method/function).
<b> 2.7.3 Sequence Diagram </b>
Describe the dynamic collaboration between a number of the object. Kegunaanya to show a series of messages sent between objects is also the interaction between object, something that occurs at a particular point in the execution of the system.
<b> 2.7.4 Statechart Diagram </b>
Statechart diagram illustrates transitions and changes state (from one state to another state) of an object on the system as a result of stimuli it receives. Statechart diagrams generally describe a particular class (a class can have more than one statechart diagram).
<b> </b> Collaboration Diagram 2.7.5
Collaboration diagram also depicts the interactions between objects such as sequence diagrams, but put more emphasis on the role of each object and not at the time of delivery of the message. Each message has a sequence number, where the message from the highest level has the number 1. Messages from the same level have the same prefix.
<b> 2.7.6 Activity Diagram </b>
Activity diagram is a special state diagram, where most of the state is mostly action and transition-trigger by the completion of the previous state (internal processing). Therefore the activity diagram does not describe the internal behavior of a system (and interactions between subsystems) are exact, but rather describes the processes and the activities of top level in General.
<b> 2.7.7 </b> Diagram Component
Component diagram illustrates the structure and relationships between software components, including dependence (dependency) in between.
<b> 2.7.8 Deployment diagram. </b>
Deployment diagram illustrates the physical/detail how components on-deploy in infrastructure system, where the component will be located (on the machine, server or hardware what), what about the ability of the network on that location, specifications of the server, and other things that are relevant.

Sublime Text is the text-based editor of the Python, a text editor, a feature-rich, cross-platform, easy and simple, which is quite popular among developers, writers, and designers. Programmers usually use sublime Text to edit the source code that is being used to do it. Up to this point Sublime Text already achieved on version 3 Beta. [Yusti, 2015]
The following are some advantages in milki Sublime Text:
1. Multi Platform
The advantages first of Sublime Text is this software is available in a variety of operating system platforms, including Windows, Linux and MacOs.
2. Open large files
Sublime Text is able to open and edit a very large text file without problems.
3. Drag Drop &
Drag and drop text files into the editor will open a new tab automatically. You can also specify the location of the tabs on the text file while dragging.
4. Editor's Sublime Text can be set as separate as a tab
Sublime Text Editor in a separate window can be set as a new tab in a way in drag. The display window can be split either vertically or horizontally.
